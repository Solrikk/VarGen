# Variation-group
This Python code reads data from a CSV file, processes it, and writes the results to another CSV file. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The code imports the csv module, which provides classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.
It defines input and output file names, the delimiter used in the CSV files, a prefix for variation codes, and an increment value.
The code opens the input and output files in read and write modes, respectively.
It reads the data from the input CSV file using a DictReader, which interprets each row as a dictionary with column headers as keys.
It checks if the fieldnames include a specific column ("Цвет" - likely "Color" in Russian) and adds a new column header "Variation group code" if it's missing.
It initializes a variation code number and iterates over each row in the input file.
It splits the values in the "Цвет" column by '/' and assigns a group code to each unique color variation.
For each color variation, it creates a new row with the color and variation group code, then writes it to the output CSV file.
This code essentially transforms CSV data by adding a variation group code based on color variations in the input file.
